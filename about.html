                    <figcaption>I joined the U.S. Coast Guard in 2004. I served as an Operations Specialist specializing in 
                        <br> search and rescue in both Northern California then Upstate New York on the Great Lakes.

                    <figcaption> After the USCG, I began personal training. After managing personal training departments
                        <br> for multiple national chains, I opened my own personal training studio, New Beginnings Fitness.

                    <figcaption>I took up welding. Although I do not continue to do it professionally, I still enjoy
                        <br>the activity, and make welding art with my personal mig welding rig at home.

                    <figcaption>I then took my welding underwater and became a certified commercial diver where I 
                        <br>became proficient in all forms of underwater construction and inspections.
                        <br>Unfortunately, injuries and surgeries made that career path come to an end. However, I still enjoy
                        <br>scuba diving and getting in the water as much as possible.

                    <figcaption>I now spend as much time with my family as possible. They are the reason I've made this 
                        <br>big career change. I've always enjoyed keeping up with technology and learning how things work, and coding 
                        <br>checks both of those boxes for me. I am looking forward to beginning this chapter of my life with an interesting
                        <br>and challenging career....that will not put me in the hospital.
