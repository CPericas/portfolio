            <figcaption align="center">I joined the U.S. Coast Guard in 2004. I served as an Operations Specialist specializing in 
                <br> search and rescue in both Northern California then Upstate New York on the Great Lakes.

            <figcaption align="center"> After the USCG, I began personal training. After managing personal training departments
                <br> for multiple national chains, I opened my own personal training studio, New Beginnings Fitness.

            <figcaption align="center">I took up welding. Although I do not continue to do it professionally, I still enjoy
                <br>the activity, and make welding art with my personal mig welding rig at home.

            <figcaption align="center">I then took my welding underwater and became a certified commercial diver where I 
                <br>became proficient in all forms of underwater construction and inspections.
                <br>Unfortunately, injuries and surgeries made that career path come to an end. However, I still enjoy
                <br>scuba diving and getting in the water as much as possible.

            <img src="picsNvids/family.jpg" alt="My Family Pic" width="300" height="300">
            <figcaption align="center">I now spend as much time with my family as possible. They are the reason I've made this 
                <br>big career change. I've always enjoyed keeping up with technology and learning how things work, and coding 
                <br>checks both of those boxes for me. I am looking forward to beginning this chapter of my life with an interesting
                <br>and challenging career....that will not put me in the hospital.
